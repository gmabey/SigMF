    ## Abstract

    The Signal Metadata Format (SigMF) specifies a way to describe sets of recorded
    digital signal samples with metadata written in JSON. SigMF can be used to
    describe general information about a collection of samples, the characteristics
    of the system that generated the samples, features of signals themselves, and the
    relationship between different recordings.

    ## Introduction

    Sharing sets of recorded signal data is an important part of science and
    engineering. It enables multiple parties to collaborate, is often a necessary
    part of reproducing scientific results (a requirement of scientific rigor), and
    enables sharing data with those who do not have direct access to the equipment
    required to capture it.

    Unfortunately, these datasets have historically not been very portable, and
    there is not an agreed upon method of sharing metadata descriptions of the
    recorded data itself. This is the problem that SigMF solves.

    By providing a standard way to describe data recordings, SigMF facilitates the
    sharing of data, prevents the "bitrot" of datasets wherein details of the
    capture are lost over time, and makes it possible for different tools to operate
    on the same dataset, thus enabling data portability between tools and workflows.

    The SigMF specification fundamentally describes two types of information:
    datasets, and metadata associated with those datasets. Taken together, a Dataset
    with its SigMF metadata is a SigMF `Recording`.

    Datasets, for purposes of this specification, are sets of digital measurements
    generically called `samples` in this document. The samples can represent any
    time-varying source of information. They MAY, for example, be digital samples
    created by digital synthesis or by an Analog-to-Digital Converter. They could
    also be geolocation coordinates from a GNSS receiver, temperature readings
    from a thermal sensor, or any other stored digital measurement information.

    Metadata describes the Dataset with which it is associated. The metadata
    includes information meant for the human users of the Dataset, such as a title
    and description, and information meant for computer applications (tools) that
    operate on the Dataset.

    This specification defines a schema for metadata using a `core` namespace that 
    is a reserved name and can only be defined by this specification. Other metadata
    MAY be described by extension namespaces. This specification also defines a 
    model and format for how SigMF data should be stored at-rest (on-disk) using JSON.

    ## Conventions Used in this Document

    The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”,
    “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be
    interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

    JSON keywords are used as defined in [ECMA-404](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-404.pdf).

    Augmented Backus-Naur form (ABNF) is used as defined by [RFC 5234](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5234)
    and updated by [RFC 7405](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7405).

    Fields defined as "human-readable", a "string", or simply as "text" SHALL be
    treated as plaintext where whitespace is significant, unless otherwise
    specified. Fields defined "human/machine-readable" SHOULD be short, simple
    text strings without whitespace that are easily understood by a human and
    readily parsed by software.

    Specific keywords with semantic meaning in the context of this specification 
    are capitalized after being introduced (e.g., Recording).

    ## Licensing

    Open licenses are RECOMMENDED but you can specify any license. You can refer to 
    resources provided by the [Open Data Commons](https://opendatacommons.org/) when 
    deciding which open license fits your needs best. Cornell University has also 
    created [a guide](https://data.research.cornell.edu/content/intellectual-property#data-licensing) 
    to help you make these choices.

    ## SigMF Compliance

    The term 'SigMF Compliant' is used throughout this document, which can take on
    one of several contextually dependent meanings. In order for a schema,
    Recording, or application to be 'SigMF Compliant', specific conditions MUST be
    met, outlined in the following sections. Provided the below criteria are met, an
    application or Recording can indicate that it is 'SigMF Compliant'.

    ### SigMF Schema Compliance

    In order to be 'SigMF Compliant', a schema MUST meet the following requirements:

    1. Adheres to and supports the metadata file naming conventions, `objects`,
    `namespaces`, and `names` specified by this document.
    1. MUST contain all REQUIRED fields with the correct datatype listed the `core`
    namespace, and any namespace listed in the `extensions` array.
    1. MUST NOT contain fields that are not outlined in the `core` or a listed
    `extensions` namespace.

    ### SigMF Recording Compliance

    In order to be 'SigMF Compliant', a Recording MUST meet the following
    requirements:

    1. The Recording's schema file MUST be SigMF Compliant.
    1. Adheres to and supports the file naming conventions and Dataset formats
    specified in this document.
    1. Stores data using the on-disk representation described by the `datatype`.

    Recordings with Non-Conforming Datasets MAY have SigMF Compliant schema, but
    cannot be SigMF Compliant Recordings.

    ### SigMF Collection Compliance

    In order to be 'SigMF Compliant', a Collection must meet the following
    requirements:

    1. The collection MUST contain only compliant Recordings.
    1. The Collection Object MUST only contain SigMF key/value pairs provided by
    the core specification or a compliant SigMF extension.

    ### SigMF Application Compliance

    In order to be 'SigMF Compliant', an application MUST meet the following
    requirements:

    1. Is capable of parsing and loading SigMF Compliant Recordings. Support for
    SigMF Collections and Archives is RECOMMENDED but not REQUIRED.
    1. Adheres to and supports the file rules, Dataset formats, `objects`,
    `namespaces`, and `names` specified by this document.
    1. MUST be able to ignore any `object` or `namespace` not specified by this
    document and still function normally.
    1. Capture Segments referring to non-existent samples SHOULD be ignored.
    1. MUST treat consecutive Capture Segments whose metadata is equivalent for
    purposes of that application (i.e., it may be different in values ignored by
    the application such as optional values or unknown extensions) as it would
    a single segment.
    1. MUST support parsing ALL required fields in the `core` namespace, and defines
    which optional fields are used by the application.
    1. MUST define which extensions are supported, parses ALL required fields in
    listed extension namespaces, and defines which optional fields are used. This
    definition can be in user documentation or within the code itself, though
    explicit documentation is RECOMMENDED.
    1. Support for ALL SigMF Datatypes is NOT REQUIRED as certain datatypes may not
    make sense for a particular application, but Compliant applications MUST
    define which datatypes are supported, and be capable of loading Compliant
    Recordings using supported datatypes.

    Compliant applications are NOT REQUIRED to support Non-Conforming Datasets or
    Metadata Only schema files, but it is RECOMMENDED that they parse the respective
    metadata fields in the `global` Object to provide descriptive messages to users
    regarding why the files are not supported.

    Support for SigMF Collections is OPTIONAL for SigMF Compliant applications,
    however it is RECOMMENDED that applications implementing SigMF make use of
    Collections when appropriate for interoperability and consistency.

    ## SigMF File Types

    There are two fundamental filetypes defined by this specification: files with 
    metadata, and the files that contain the Datasets described by the metadata. There
    are two types of files containing metadata, a SigMF `Metadata` file, and a SigMF
    `Collection` file. There are also two types of Datasets, a SigMF `Dataset` file, 
    and a `Non-Conforming Dataset` file, abbreviated as `NCD`.

    The primary unit of SigMF is a SigMF `Recording`, which comprises a Metadata file
    and the Dataset file it describes. Collections are an optional feature that are 
    used to describe the relationships between multiple Recordings. 

    Collections and multiple Recordings can be packaged for easy storage and 
    distribution in a SigMF `Archive`.

    ```

    Rules for all files:
    1. All filetypes MUST be stored in separate files on-disk.
    1. It is RECOMMENDED that filenames use hyphens to separate words rather than
    whitespace or underscores.

    Rules for SigMF Metadata files:
    1. A Metadata file MUST only describe one Dataset file.
    1. A Metadata file MUST be stored in UTF-8 encoding.
    1. A Metadata file MUST have a `.sigmf-meta` filename extension.
    1. A Metadata file MUST be in the same directory as the Dataset file it
    describes.
    1. It is RECOMMENDED that the base filenames (not including file extension) of
    a Recording's Metadata and Dataset files be identical.

    Rules for SigMF Dataset files:
    1. The Dataset file MUST have a `.sigmf-data` filename extension.

    Rules for SigMF Non-Conforming Dataset files:
    1. The NCD file MUST NOT have a `.sigmf-data` filename extension.

    Rules for SigMF Collection files:
    1. The Collection file MUST be stored in UTF-8 encoding.
    1. The Collection file MUST have a `.sigmf-collection` filename extension.
    1. The `sigmf-collection` file MUST be either in the same directory as the
    Recordings that it references, or in the top-level directory of an Archive
    (described in later section).

    Rules for SigMF Archive files:
    1. The Archive MUST use the `tar` archive format, as specified by POSIX.1-2001.
    1. The Archive file's filename extension MUST be `.sigmf`.
    1. The Archive MUST contain at least one SigMF Recording.
    1. The Archive MAY contain one `.sigmf-collection` file in the top-level
    directory.
    1. SigMF Archives MAY contain additional files (not specified by SigMF), and
    arbitrary directory structures, but the SigMF files within the Archive MUST
    adhere to all rules above when the archive is extracted.

    ## SigMF Dataset Format

    There are four orthogonal characteristics of sample data: complex or real, 
    floating-point or integer, bit-width, and endianness. The following ABNF 
    rules specify the Dataset formats defined in the Core namespace. Additional
    Dataset formats MAY be added through extensions.

    ```abnf
        dataset-format = (real / complex) ((type endianness) / byte)

        real = "r"
        complex = "c"

        type = floating-point / signed-integer / unsigned-integer
        floating-point = "f32" / "f64"
        signed-integer = "i32" / "i16"
        unsigned-integer = "u32" / "u16"

        endianness = little-endian / big-endian
        little-endian = "_le"
        big-endian = "_be"

        byte = "i8" / "u8"
    ```

    So, for example, the string `"cf32_le"` specifies "complex 32-bit floating-point
    samples stored in little-endian", the string `"ru16_be"` specifies "real
    unsigned 16-bit samples stored in big-endian", and the string `"cu8"` specifies
    "complex unsigned byte".

    Only IEEE-754 single-precision and double-precision floating-point types are
    supported by the SigMF Core namespace. Note that complex data types are
    specified by the bit width of the individual I/Q components, and not by the
    total complex pair bitwidth (like Numpy).

    The samples SHOULD be written to the Dataset file without separation, and the
    Dataset file MUST NOT contain any other characters (e.g., delimiters,
    whitespace, line-endings, EOF characters).

    Complex samples MUST be interleaved, with the in-phase component first (i.e.,
    `I[0]` `Q[0]` `I[1]` `Q[1]` ... `I[n]` `Q[n]`). When `core:num_channels` in the
    Global Object (described below) indicates that the Recording contains more than one channel,
    samples from those channels MUST be interleaved in the same manner, with
    the same index from each channel's sample serially in the Recording. For
    example, a Recording with two channels of `ri16_le` representing real-valued
    audio data from a stereo Recording and here labeled `L` for left and `R` for
    right, the data MUST appear as `L[0]` `R[0]` `L[1]` `R[1]` ... `L[n]` `R[n]`.
    The data type specified by `core:data_type` applies to all channels of data
    both real and imaginary parts.

    ## SigMF Metadata Format

    SigMF metadata fundamentally takes the form of key/value pairs:

    ```JSON
    "namespace:name": value,
    ```

    Metadata field names in the top level `global` Object, `captures` segment
    Objects, or `annotations` Objects MUST be of this form. All fields other than
    those at the top level which contain a `:` delimiter SHALL only use letters,
    numbers, and the `_` character; all other characters are forbidden. Field names
    MUST NOT start with a number and MUST NOT not be C++20 or Python 3.10 keywords.

    When stored on-disk (at-rest), these rules apply:
    1. The Metadata file MUST be written in [JSON](http://www.json.org/), as specified
    by [ECMA-404](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-404.pdf).
    1. The entire contents of the Metadata file MUST be contained within a single
    top-level JSON Object.
    1. The top-level Object MUST contain three JSON Objects named `global`, `captures`,
    and `annotations`.
    1. Metadata key/value pairs SHALL NOT be assumed to have carried over between
    capture or annotation segments. If a name/value pair applies to a particular
    segment, then it MUST appear in that segment, even if the value is unchanged
    relative to the previous segment.

    All SigMF metadata is defined using the structural concepts of JSON, and when 
    stored on-disk, metadata MUST be proper JSON to be SigMF compliant.

    ### Datatypes

    The values in each key/value pair MUST be one of the following datatypes.

    | type    | long-form name                         | description                                                   |
    | ------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | int     | integer                                | Signed 64-bit integer.                                        |
    | uint    | unsigned long                          | Unsigned 64-bit integer.                                      |
    | double  | double-precision floating-point number | A 64-bit float as defined by IEEE 754.                        |
    | string  | string                                 | A string of characters, as defined by the JSON standard.      |
    | boolean | boolean                                | Either `true` or `false`, as defined by the JSON standard.    |
    | null    | null                                   | `null`, as defined by the JSON standard.                      |
    | array   | JSON `array`                           | An `array` of other values, as defined by the JSON standard.  |
    | object  | JSON `object`                          | An `object` of other values, as defined by the JSON standard. |
    | GeoJSON | GeoJSON `point` Object                 | A single GeoJSON `point` Object as defined by RFC 7946.       |

    ### Namespaces

    Namespaces provide a way to further classify key/value pairs in metadata.
    This specification defines the `core` namespace. Only this specification
    can add fields to the Core namespace.

    The goal of the Core namespace is to capture the foundational metadata 
    necessary to work with SigMF data. Some keys within the Core namespace are
    OPTIONAL, and others are REQUIRED. The REQUIRED fields are those that are
    minimally necessary to parse and process the Dataset, or that have obvious
    defaults that are valid. All other fields are OPTIONAL, though they can be
    strongly RECOMMENDED.

    #### Extension Namespaces

    Fields not defined in the Core namespace MAY be defined in extension
    namespaces. The SigMF specification defines some extension namespaces to
    provide canonical definitions for commonly needed metadata fields that do not
    belong in Core. These canonical extension namespaces can be found in the
    `extensions/` directory of the official SigMF repository. Other extension
    namespaces MAY be defined by the user as needed.

    1. An extension namespace MUST be defined in a single file, named
    meta-syntactically as `N.sigmf-ext.md`, where `N` is the name of the extension.
    1. A `N.sigmf-ext.md` file MUST be a Github-Flavored Markdown file stored in UTF-8
    encoding.
    1. Extensions MUST have version numbers. It is RECOMMENDED that extensions use
    [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
    1. An extension namespace MAY define new top-level SigMF Objects, key/value
    pairs, new files, new Dataset formats, or new datatypes.
    1. New key/value pairs defined by an extension namespace MUST be defined in
    the context of a specific SigMF top-level Object - i.e., `global`,
    `captures`, `annotations`, or a new user-defined Object.
    1. It is RECOMMENDED that an extension namespace file follow the structure of
    the canonical extension namespaces.

    NOTE - IT WAS AT THIS POINT IN THE ORIGINAL SPECS THAT WE INCLUDED THE GLOBAL/CAPTURES/ANNOTATIONS PORTION

    ## SigMF Collection Format

    The `sigmf-collection` file contains metadata in a single top-level Object 
    called a `collection`. The Collection Object contains key/value pairs that 
    describe relationships between SigMF Recordings.

    The Collection Object associates SigMF Recordings together by specifying
    `SigMF Recording Objects` in the `core:streams` JSON array. Each Object
    describes a specific associated SigMF Recording.

    The following rules apply to SigMF Collections:

    1. The Collection Object MUST be the only top-level Object in the file.
    1. Keys in the Collection Object SHOULD use SigMF Recording Objects when
    referencing SigMF Recordings.
    1. SigMF Recording Objects MUST contain both a `name` field, which is the
    base-name of a SigMF Recording, and a `hash` which is the SHA512 hash of
    the Recording Metadata file `[base-name].sigmf-meta`.
    1. SigMF Recording Objects MUST appear in a JSON array.

    ## SigMF Recording Objects

    `SigMF Recording Objects` reference the base-name of the SigMF Recording and the
    SHA512 hash of the Metadata file, and SHOULD BE specified as a JSON Object:

    ```JSON
    {
        "name": "example-channel-0-basename",
        "hash": "b4071db26f5c7b0c70f5066eb9bc3a8b506df0f5af09991ba481f63f97f7f48e9396584bc1c296650cd3d47bc4ad2c5b72d2561078fb6eb16151d2898c9f84c4"
    }
    ```

    Recording Tuples are also permitted and have a similar form. The order of
    the tuple: [`name`, `hash`] is REQUIRED when using tuples:

    ```JSON
    ["example-channel-0-basename", "b4071db26f5c7b0c70f5066eb9bc3a8b506df0f5af09991ba481f63f97f7f48e9396584bc1c296650cd3d47bc4ad2c5b72d2561078fb6eb16151d2898c9f84c4"]
    ```

    Tuples will be removed in SigMF version 2.0, so JSON Objects are RECOMMENDED.
    Additional optional user fields MAY be added to `SigMF Recording Objects` if
    they are defined in a compliant SigMF extension. Additional fields are NOT
    permitted in tuples.

            be done when the Dataset will be generated dynamically from information in the

        description: |
            The `core:geolocation` field in the Global Object is used to store the
            location of the recording system. The location is stored as a single
            [RFC 7946](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7946.txt) GeoJSON `point` Object
            using the convention defined by [RFC 5870](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5870.txt).
            Per the GeoJSON specification, the point coordinates use the WGS84 coordinate
            reference system and are `longitude`, `latitude` (REQUIRED, in decimal degrees),
            and `altitude` (OPTIONAL, in meters above the WGS84 ellipsoid) - in that order. An
            example including the altitude field is shown below:

            ```JSON
            "global": {
                ...
                "core:geolocation": {
                "type": "Point",
                "coordinates": [-107.6183682, 34.0787916, 2120.0]
                }
                ...
            }
            ```

            GeoJSON permits the use of *Foreign Members* in GeoJSON documents per RFC 7946
            Section 6.1. Because the SigMF requirement for the `geolocation` field is to be
            a valid GeoJSON `point` Object, users MAY include *Foreign Member* fields here
            for user-defined purposes (position valid indication, GNSS SV counts, dillution
            of precision, accuracy, etc). It is strongly RECOMMENDED that all fields be
            documented in a SigMF Extension document.

            *Note:* Objects named `geometry` or `properties` are prohibited Foreign Members
            as specified in RFC 7946 Section 7.1.

                date-fullyear   = 4DIGIT
                date-month      = 2DIGIT  ; 01-12
                date-mday       = 2DIGIT  ; 01-28, 01-29, 01-30, 01-31 based on month/year
                                            
                time-hour       = 2DIGIT  ; 00-23
                time-minute     = 2DIGIT  ; 00-59
                time-second     = 2DIGIT  ; 00-58, 00-59, 00-60 based on leap second rules
                                            
                time-secfrac    = "." 1*DIGIT
                time-offset     = "Z"

                partial-time    = time-hour ":" time-minute ":" time-second [time-secfrac]
                full-date       = date-fullyear "-" date-month "-" date-mday
                full-time       = partial-time time-offset

                date-time       = full-date "T" full-time
                ```

                Thus, timestamps take the form of `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSSZ`, where any number
                of digits for fractional seconds is permitted.

                The entirety of which may not have been captured in a recorded Dataset.
                If omitted, this value SHOULD be treated as equal to `sample_start`.

                For example, some hardware devices are capable of 'counting' samples at
                the point of data conversion. This sample count is commonly used to indicate 
                a discontinuity in the datastream between the hardware device and processing.

                For example, in the below Captures array, there are two Segments describing
                samples in a SigMF Dataset file. The first Segment begins at the start of the 
                Dataset file. The second segment begins at sample index 500 relative to the
                recorded samples (and since this is a conforming SigMF Dataset, is physically
                located on-disk at location `sample_start * sizeof(sample)`), but the 
                `global_index` reports this was actually sample number 1000 in the original
                datastream, indicating that 500 samples were lost before they could be recorded.

            description: |
                The number of bytes preceding a chunk of samples that are not sample data, used for NCDs.
                This field specifies a number of bytes that are not valid sample data that 
                are physically located at the start of where the chunk of samples referenced 
                by this Segment would otherwise begin. If omitted, this value SHOULD
                be treated as equal zero. If included, the Dataset is by definition a
                Non-Conforming Dataset.

                For example, the below Metadata for a Non-Conforming Dataset contains
                two segments describing chunks of 8-bit complex samples (2 bytes per sample) 
                recorded to disk with 4-byte headers that are not valid for 
                processing. Thus, to map these two chunks of samples into memory, a reader
                application would map the `500 samples` (equal to `1000 bytes`) in the first 
                Segment, starting at a file offset of `4 bytes`, and then the remainder of the 
                file through EOF starting at a file offset of `1008 bytes` (equal to the size 
                of the previous Segment of samples plus two headers).

        The `annotations` value is an array of annotation segment objects

        `core:sample_start` key, ascending.

        Annotation segment Objects contain key/value pairs and MUST contain a 
        `core:sample_start` key/value pair, which indicates the first index 
        at which the rest of the Segment's key/value pairs apply.

        There is no limit to the number of annotations that can apply to the same group
        of samples. If two annotations have the same `sample_start`, there is no
        defined ordering between them. If `sample_count` is not provided, it SHOULD
        be assumed that the annotation applies from `sample_start` through the end of
        the Dataset, in all other cases `sample_count` MUST be provided.
